### Description

```
In this activity, you'll create a new React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment requires you to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.
```

#### User Story

```
As a person I like to Read Books... 
or at least think about reading books... 
or at least making lists of books that I could think about reading one day. 
As this Kind of Person, I would like to be able to Search for Books 
using the Google Books Library and find books that I am interested in. 
I should be able to Save books to my 
virtual bookshelf that I want to read later. 
And I should be able to delete books from that saved books list, 
when i decide i will never read them.
```

#### More Details

```
Worked really hard on this. Both on getting it to look really nice and function smoothly and intuitively.
